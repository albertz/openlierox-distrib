There are several scripts in this repository which should do all the compiling,
testing, packaging and uploading to SF automatically.

The functions of each scripts are:

*_build.sh:

This will make a release build for the specific platform.

*_test_binary.sh:

Expects that the binary was compiled before by *_build.sh. It will do some simple tests.
This mostly (e.g. on OSX) means that it will try to execute the binary and quit it 
immediatly.

*_pack.sh:

This runs both *_build.sh and *_test_binary.sh if possible. Then, the main functionallity 
of this script is to generate the specific packages for the target system. (E.g. on OSX, 
it creates the DMG, on Win32, it creates all the ZIPs, this also creates the deb-files 
for Debian, etc.)
